  ## Background: The Power of Logging and Replay
  
  In AI agent development, prompts can dramatically affect your results. Logging prompts—along with their variables—offers several key advantages:
  
  - **Experiment Tracking**: Record each prompt and context to track what you tried and what worked.
  - **Reproducibility**: Replay prompts exactly as used before for consistent results and easier debugging.
  - **Collaboration**: Share logs to build on team efforts, compare approaches, and avoid duplication.
  - **Analysis and Optimization**: Analyze logged prompts to identify best outcomes and refine strategies.
  - **Transparency**: Maintain workflow transparency for responsible AI development.
  
  Replayability lets you rerun experiments, validate improvements, and demonstrate results—all with minimal overhead.
  
  Welcome to **log-prompt**—a lightweight tool designed for AI agent developers who need to keep track of their prompt templates and variables.
  
  ## Why Use log-prompt?
  
  AI agent developers test many prompts and variables. Tracking them for reproducibility and analysis is hard—log-prompt makes it easy:
  
  - **Organize**: Store prompts and variables in a searchable database.
  - **No duplicates**: Only unique combinations are saved.
  - **Tagging**: Add tags for easy filtering.
  - **Recall**: Instantly retrieve any prompt and its variables.
  
  ## When Should You Use log-prompt?
  
  Use log-prompt when you need to:
  - Track prompt engineering iterations
  - Share prompt setups across teams or projects
  - Analyze which prompts and variables perform best
  - Ensure reproducibility and transparency in your workflow
  
  log-prompt is simple, fast, and fits seamlessly into your prototyping process.
  
  ## Comparison: log-prompt vs Other Tools
  
  **log-prompt** is designed to be:
  - **Lightweight**: Simple integration, minimal dependencies
  - **Local and Private**: Your data stays on your machine
  - **No Cloud Required**: Works offline with local SQLite database
  - **Flexible**: Easily adaptable Python function and schema
  
  **LangSmith** and similar platforms offer cloud dashboards, team collaboration, and LLM pipeline integrations—excellent for production and larger teams, but potentially excessive for solo developers or quick experiments.
  
  **Choose log-prompt for:**
  - Local, simple prompt tracking and replay
  - Minimal setup and maximum privacy
  - Full control over data and workflow
  
  **Choose tools like LangSmith for:**
  - Cloud-based dashboards and analytics
  - Built-in LLM provider integrations
  - Enterprise features and team management
  
  log-prompt excels at fast iteration, experimentation, and personal projects—delivering core prompt logging benefits without overhead.
  
  ## Where to Get log-prompt
  
  You can get log-prompt directly from the project repository or by copying the Python file into your project:
  
  - **GitHub**: [github.com/alroborol/log-prompt](https://github.com/alroborol/log-prompt)
  
  No installation or dependencies required beyond Python’s standard library.
